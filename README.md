# Gen AI Model Frontend

This project is a frontend-only user interface for a Generative AI tool, built using HTML and CSS. It mimics the structure and design of popular AI platforms like ChatGPT. The interface is clean and easy to use, allowing users to interact with AI tools.

## Features

- Modern search bar with embedded icons for images and search
- Auto-sliding prompt suggestions every 5 seconds
- Responsive layout for desktops and tablets
- Sidebar-ready structure for future tool links
- Built using pure HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript frameworks

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
3. Explore the UI and prompts. You can add backend integration later.

## Future Enhancements

- JavaScript-based backend integration for API calls
- Click-to-fill feature for prompts
- File upload functionality with preview
